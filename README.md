Welcome to the Brain Games project! This project includes 5 games: brain-even, brain-calc, brain-progression, brain-prime, and brain-gcd. Each game challenges your brain in a different way, from testing your ability to recognize even numbers to finding the greatest common divisor of given numbers.

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using "git clone [https://github.com/hexletTest9027/frontend-project-44.git](https://github.com/hexletTest9027/frontend-project-44.git)"
2. Navigate to the "FRONTEND-PROJECT-44" folder.
3. Use NPM to install required packages by running "npm install".
4. To start a game, use this pattern: "make [game name]".
5. Try to win each game and challenge yourself!

This is my first HEXLET-PROJECT. I hope you have fun playing these games and improving your brain's abilities. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance. ðŸ˜ŠðŸ§ ðŸŽ®
